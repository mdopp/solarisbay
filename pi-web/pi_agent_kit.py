"""`pi-web-agent-kit` — turn ServiceBay's delivered agent kit into Pi's own shapes.

ServiceBay delivers one read-only checkout to the box (servicebay#2908) and the
pod mounts three of its directories at `/opt/servicebay`: `agent-cli/` (the
`servicebay` CLI), `agent-docs/AGENTS.md` (the box's agent handbook) and
`assists/` (the 55-entry catalog of ADRs, recipes, guides and footguns). Pi does
not read any of those where they lie — it reads **its own** locations, and this
script is the bridge:

  * an assist becomes `<agent-dir>/skills/servicebay/<id>/SKILL.md`, because Pi
    loads skills as Agent-Skills packages (`name` + `description` frontmatter,
    one directory per skill) and an assist's frontmatter is `title`/`whenToUse`
    /`kind`/`tags` — the same content in a different shape, so it is generated
    rather than symlinked;
  * `agent-docs/AGENTS.md` becomes `<agent-dir>/AGENTS.md` with a short
    box-specific prelude in front of it. Pi concatenates the context files it
    finds; it has no include, so the prelude and the shipped file have to be one
    file.

It runs as an init container on **every** pod start and is idempotent — a file
whose content already matches is left alone. That is also how a catalog update
reaches the sessions: ServiceBay refreshes the checkout hourly, the next pod
start regenerates from it.

Nothing here writes into the mount: it is read-only, and an edit there would be
gone within the hour anyway (ADR 0014).

"""Frontend-contract checks for settings-as-/command cards + the /search card.

#410 retires the standalone settings panel: each former Settings tab becomes a
/command that posts its pane as an inline card in the conversation (the model
picker / VRAM bar / skill editor move intact). #411 moves the in-chat search off
the header onto a /search {text} card that searches-as-you-type, and merges the
two stacked mobile bars (topbar + chat-header) into one. The real check is the
box-verify of the rendered cards; these lock the markup/JS contract.

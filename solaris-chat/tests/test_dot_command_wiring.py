"""Behaviour-wiring guards for the `.tool` dot-commands (ADR 0009).

The other frontend tests assert that a symbol *exists*. These assert that each
dot-command is actually WIRED to do its job — the create posts the right action,
and every result row is actionable (opens / edits / toggles), not an inert label.
They exist because "looks wired but the click does nothing" bugs (a note result
with no click handler, duplicate hits, a create pointed at the wrong action) slip
past string-presence checks. Still static (regex over the served HTML), so they
gate the wiring, not the rendered runtime — the real proof is the box-verify.

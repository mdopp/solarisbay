"""Paperless document push (#931).

The paperless REST client and the Ollama vision call are both faked (no live
instance, no model): these cover the PoC-validated handoff — gemma4:12b vision
(think:false + a downscaled image) → POST the file OCR-skipped → PATCH the clean
text into paperless full-text search — plus the idempotency marker, the
disabled-when-unconfigured no-op, and the graceful degrade when the file is
missing or paperless dedups the upload.

"""Frontend-contract checks for the persona × speed selection (#278, #420).

The persona × speed choice no longer lives in a chat-header dropdown: #420
removed the Settings button and the top persona dropdown and moved the choice
to the `/persona` slash command, which crosses each persona with a speed
(schnell/Thinking) plus the admin profile and persists the pick for the NEXT
new chat (mapping back to the unchanged payload.personality + payload.reasoning
wiring). The household "Zuhause" chat always runs fast. The user-facing Thema
topic picker is retired (#279d) — inline #tag/@person mentions replace it; only
the internal household binding stays. The real check is the box-verify across
the contexts; these lock the markup/JS contract.

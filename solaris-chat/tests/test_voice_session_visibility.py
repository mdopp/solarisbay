"""Voice turns land in the shared "Zuhause" every resident opens (#649).

With speaker-ID off, all voice is anonymous-household: the facade persists
each spoken turn via `respond_session(uid="household")` into the deterministic
`household_session_id("household")` row (owner_uid=`household`). Before #649 the
browser's Zuhause opened a DIFFERENT row per resident (`household_session_id(
<Remote-User>)`), so the spoken history was invisible to everyone logged in.

The fix re-points `whoami` at the ONE shared row and admits any resident to it
via `effective_uid`, while a typed turn keeps its caller's identity (turn_uid)
so timers/facts stay theirs. A future speaker-ID hit still lands in the
resident's own session — the regression guard here proves that path is intact.

"""The neighbour-service GPU lease over HTTP (#1333, contract
mdopp/foundry-chronicle#321).

The endpoint keeps the shape foundry built against in #1260 and now fronts the
box's GPU lease. What is pinned here is the state machine they poll — 200
`ready` / 202 `preparing` / 409 `held` / 400 / 503 — the request file the host
broker acts on, the alias every surface reports the loaded model by, the
holder (#1347) that decides whose window a `DELETE` may close, and the
`releasing` (#1364) a window reads as while the broker has the request but has
not yet given the card back.

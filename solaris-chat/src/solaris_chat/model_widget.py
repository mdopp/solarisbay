"""The Modell tile — the GPU lease as a `kind: tool` widget (#1374).

`GET /api/model-lease` answers with ONE state; a `.tool` needs **rows**. This
module is that translation plus the two things a resident-operated window needs
that a service-operated one never did:

* **A window said in human terms.** A service asks for `ttl_s`; a resident taps
  "4 Stunden" or "bis morgen 07:00". `parse_until` turns either into the
  seconds the contract wants, and `rows` says the result back as "bis 16:30"
  rather than as an epoch.
* **The row IS the choice.** The app resolves exactly ONE action per tool
  (ADR 0014 — the first declared id the row can fill wins, a second is
  unreachable), so a duration cannot be a second button next to the profile.
  Every profile therefore gets one row per window it offers, each carrying its
  own `profile` + `hours` for the tile's single `model.set` (#1381).
* **A holder that is not the caller.** foundry and pi-web hold their own
  windows and renew them from their own process. Nobody renews on behalf of a
  phone that has been put back in a pocket, so the **engine** takes the window
  (`holder: "widget"`) and `hold` renews it until the chosen end, then releases.
  There is no auto-extension: the loop never asks for more than the window the
  resident chose, and the box's own timer is the net under it.

The operator's decision of 2026-09-08: fixed durations (1/2/4 h) **and** target
times, scope household, countdown/end time on the card, the card comes back by
itself.

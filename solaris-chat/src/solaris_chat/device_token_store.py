"""SQLite access to the resident device-auth tokens.

Reads/writes the `device_tokens` table (migration 0021) in solaris.db — the
operational state behind native-client bearer auth (#717). Same shape as
`push_store`/`favorites_store`: sync sqlite3 (each op is millisecond-cheap),
WAL + busy_timeout, and reads degrade to empty when the DB or table is missing
(the schema-init sidecar hasn't migrated yet), so the engine is safe to deploy
before the migration lands.

A native Android widget/tile can't ride the browser's Authelia cookies, so it
authenticates with a long-lived bearer minted from an authenticated interactive
session. Security invariants held here:

- The plaintext token is NEVER stored. Only its `sha256` hex digest lives in the
  DB; the plaintext (`sol_device_<token_urlsafe(32)>`) is returned to the caller
  exactly once, at creation.
- Lookup is by the stored hash and uses a constant-time compare, so a timing
  side channel can't probe the hash space.
- Scoping is per-resident: every row carries `owner_uid`; a resolved token
  authenticates as its owner and a revoke is owner-checked.
- Fail closed: a revoked or unknown token resolves to None, never a fallback uid.

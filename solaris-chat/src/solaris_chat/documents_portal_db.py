"""DB-backed document category views (#doc).

An uploaded document is extracted into a `document` entity carrying typed facts
(`category`, `provider`, `policy_number`, `cancellation_deadline`, …) — see
`engine/ingest/obsidian.py::_ingest_document`. The markdown renderer can't do
tables, so the Notizen "documents" page renders these DB-backed instead: one
doorway per category, and a table per category built straight from the
`entities`+`facts` projection (mirrors `notes_portal_db.py`).

Owner scope is the entity's `resident_uid`: the caller sees their own documents
plus the shared household pool, never another resident's (matches
`projection.entity_facts` scoping). Each fact carries its `confidence`, so the
UI can flag an unconfirmed (agent-extracted, 0.6) value vs. a human-confirmed
(1.0) one; per predicate the highest-confidence value wins.

Returns ``None`` when the projection is absent (fresh install / migration not
run) so the caller can degrade gracefully.

"""Project document deadlines + dated to-do tasks into PER-RESIDENT calendars
(#doc-graph / #todo / #997).

A document carries dated facts — a `cancellation_deadline`, a `hu_date`, a
contract `end_date`. Rather than push notifications, we write each as an all-day
event with an advance alarm into a calendar, where the calendar app itself
reminds the resident (the passive, non-intrusive channel the plan chose).

Solaris owns, the calendar mirrors (#997, option A / #1011): every resident's
Solaris calendar lives under the RESIDENT's OWN principal tree —
`{base}/{resident_uid}/solaris/` — a `solaris`-named calendar under each resident.
The resident reads/writes their own tree as themselves (owner_only), so they
subscribe on the phone with their OWN login — no shared service password. The
`solaris` service account is granted a narrow Radicale rights rule to WRITE only
`/<resident>/solaris/` (nothing else). A resident's private dated task lands only
in their own `/{resident_uid}/solaris/` collection; household-scoped document
deadlines and household tasks (`SHARED_UID`) go to `{base}/{SHARED_UID}/solaris/`.

**Authenticated CalDAV PUT** as the dedicated `solaris` DAV account, not a
filesystem mount: Radicale's rights scope it to the collections it may write.
The event UID is derived from `(entity_id, predicate)` / the task id, so a
re-sync overwrites in place. Non-ISO / unparseable dates are skipped. Disabled
(no-op) when the base URL / credentials are unset.

"""Engine night jobs — the Hermes cron registry, reborn as code.

The three background jobs (daily-chronicle, problem-summarizer,
chat-compactor) used to be registered into Hermes' jobs.json by the
post-deploy, which de-duped badly across upgrades (#332 follow-up). Here
they are defined in code — idempotent by construction — and run on the deep
profile (e4b, thinks by default — 12b retired 2026-07-13).

Schedules are evaluated in local time (the household clock the prompts talk
about). A durable last-run stamp in solaris.db (`engine_cron_runs`) keys on
the fired slot, so a restart inside the cron minute never double-runs a job
and a restart spanning the slot fires it late instead of skipping the day.

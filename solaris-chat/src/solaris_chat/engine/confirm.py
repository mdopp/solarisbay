"""Deterministic confirmation gate for sensitive HA actions (#570).

`offer_choices` + the tool-discipline prompt (u64/#558) ask the model to
confirm before opening/unlocking the house, but gemma4:e4b obeys it only
sometimes — "Garagentor öffnen" sometimes executes with a bare "Klar.". For a
safety feature "usually" is not enough, so the engine ENFORCES it in code: a
`ha_call_service` on a sensitive target is intercepted at dispatch, not run, and
held until the user's next reply confirms it.

This module owns the policy (what is sensitive, what counts as yes/no) and the
per-session stash of the pending action; the loop in client.py calls `gate()`
before dispatching a tool and consumes a stashed action at the top of a turn.

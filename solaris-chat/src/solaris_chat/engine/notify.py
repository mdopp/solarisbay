"""Web Push notifier — fan a timer/reminder out to a resident's phones (#713).

The timer scheduler's speaker announce stays primary; this is a best-effort
second channel so a reminder reaches the resident away from the Voice PE
speaker, through the installed PWA's service worker (standard Web Push / VAPID,
no Google/FCM). Constructed once at boot and injected into `TimerScheduler`.

No-op when VAPID is unset (`enabled` is False): the keys are an operator
prerequisite, not in the repo, so nothing breaks on the box before they are
configured — `push()` returns immediately. Errors are logged and swallowed; a
404/410 prunes the dead endpoint. The notifier must never break the timer loop.

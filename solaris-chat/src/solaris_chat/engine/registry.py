"""HA entity registry for prompt injection — the second-roundtrip killer.

Injecting the controllable-entity registry (id | name | area, NO live state)
into the system prompt lets the model call `ha_call_service` with the right
entity_id directly instead of spending an LLM pass on `ha_list_entities`
first — the same approach HA's own Assist uses. Live state is deliberately
absent: it goes stale in a cached prompt, and the soul rule "read live state
before answering" stays for state questions.

The block is sorted and stable so the KV prefix cache keeps hitting; a TTL
refresh picks up registry changes (new/renamed devices) within minutes.

"""Paperless document push (#931): store each upload in paperless with the
clean gemma4:12b vision text indexed for full-text search.

Paperless is a document store + Web-UI + full-text search only; its own
Tesseract OCR is skipped (the #929 PoC proved it garbles rotated German scans),
so paperless never derives the searchable text — Solaris does. For each upload
companion this adapter:

  1. runs the EXISTING gemma4:12b vision extractor to transcribe clean text
     (`think:false` + a ~300 KB downscaled first page — the PoC found the
     full-res pages return an EMPTY vision response);
  2. POSTs the original file to paperless (consumed OCR-skipped);
  3. PATCHes `/api/documents/{id}/` with `content=<that text>` so paperless's
     full-text search indexes the clean text.

Result: paperless owns the store/UI/search; Solaris's gemma4 stays the fact +
text source. Disabled (no-op) when `PAPERLESS_URL`/`PAPERLESS_TOKEN` are unset.
A `<!-- paperless -->` marker in the companion is the idempotency guard so a
re-run neither re-uploads nor re-transcribes.

Push timing is deliberately LAZY-via-cron, not eager-at-upload (#1042). The
push is gated on `EXTRACTED_MARKER`, so it can only run once the upload's text
has been extracted — and `napi_upload` already runs that extraction
fire-and-forget off the request path (pdftotext/OCR is too slow to block the
HTTP response). Since the push depends on that deferred step AND itself runs a
multi-second gemma4:12b vision transcription per document, it stays off the
upload path too: `run_ingest`/`push_uploads` drives it on the periodic ingest
cycle, marker-gated and idempotent, so a document lost to a restart is simply
picked up on the next pass. Eager-at-upload would buy a shorter store-to-search
lag at the cost of a slow, vision-heavy upload request — not worth it for a
document store whose search is not latency-critical.

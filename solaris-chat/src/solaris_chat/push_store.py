"""SQLite access to the resident Web Push subscriptions.

Reads/writes the `push_subscriptions` table (migration 0020) in solaris.db —
the operational state behind Web Push (#713). Same shape as `favorites_store`:
sync sqlite3 (each op is millisecond-cheap), WAL + busy_timeout, and reads
degrade to empty when the DB or table is missing (the schema-init sidecar
hasn't migrated yet), so the engine is safe to deploy before the migration
lands.

Scoping is per-resident: every row carries the owning `owner_uid`; a read
returns that resident's own endpoints only. The browser endpoint URL is the
natural unique key, so `upsert` re-registers an existing endpoint (its owner may
change residents on a shared device) instead of duplicating it.

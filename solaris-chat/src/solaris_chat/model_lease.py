"""The neighbour-service GPU lease over HTTP (#1333, contract
mdopp/foundry-chronicle#321).

`POST/DELETE /api/model-lease` was the Ollama-era model swap (#1260): for the
duration of a declared window Solaris answered with the model foundry already
held. With llama.cpp serving one model at a time (#1318) that swap no longer
exists — the real primitive is the box's GPU lease (#1319/#1325), which
reloads llama-server on the leased profile. This module keeps the HTTP shape
foundry built against and makes it the front for that primitive.

The engine cannot switch systemd units from inside its container, so it does
not try: a request is *written* to `gpu_lease_request.json` and a host
`solaris-gpu-lease-broker.path` runs `gpu-lease.py` for it. Which means the
HTTP layer never blocks on a 12 GB download — it answers from the two files
the box owns:

* `gpu_lease.json` — the lease itself, written by `gpu-lease.py`. Its `ready`
  flag is what separates `preparing` from `ready`.
* `gpu_lease_status.json` — what the broker did with the last request. Its
  `requested_at` is compared against the request's, so a request still to be
  picked up reads as `preparing` instead of as no lease at all.

Everything here fails **open**: an unreadable or missing file reads as "no
lease", i.e. the household model on a normal box.

Since #1347 a window also names the **holder** that asked for it, so a service
restarting can tell its own open window from a stranger's instead of closing
whatever it finds: `POST` takes an optional `holder`, `GET` reports it, and
`DELETE {"holder": ...}` releases only a matching window. A holder is the
identity of the *service* — one permanent name, the same for every window it
ever takes — never a session, round, group or person, which is why the shape is
pinned to a short token rather than left as free text.

Since #1361 a window also **ends when its holder stops renewing**, not only at
the deadline. Two rules, one on each side:

* **Broker side.** Every `POST` stamps `last_renewed_at` on the window, and the
  box arms its release for the **grace** — `2 x renew_after`, i.e. two missed
  renewals — instead of for the full TTL. A holder that keeps renewing never
  notices; a holder that dies without a `DELETE` loses the card after the grace
  (10 minutes on a 900 s window) rather than after the TTL, which for a 4-hour
  coding window would have kept the household on the wrong model all afternoon.
  The TTL stays the outer net: the release is never armed past it. `GET`
  reports both `last_renewed_at` and `renew_after` so a holder can see this
  arithmetic instead of having to know it.
* **Consumer side.** A service that died with a window open cannot tell from
  its own memory that it still holds one — that state died with the process.
  So **on start it does a `GET`, and if `holder` is its own name it `DELETE`s
  with that holder first.** The call is idempotent and, on a clean start, a
  no-op: there is no window to find. This is the rule
  `mdopp/foundry-chronicle#333` was waiting for, and `templates/pi-web`
  follows it in its host lease unit.

Since #1364 the giving back is as asynchronous as the taking, and says so.
`DELETE` only writes the request; the broker starts the units back up and
waits for the household model before it removes the lease file, which is
seconds during which the window is neither held nor gone. That in-between is
`releasing` — reported by `GET` and answered by `DELETE` itself — and the
contract addendum on `mdopp/foundry-chronicle#321` is:

* `releasing` always carries `retry_after`, from the same source `preparing`
  takes it from.
* After a `DELETE` a consumer waits for `none`. It never sends a second
  `DELETE` for a window that reads `releasing` or `preparing`.
* Giving up on waiting is harmless: the release runs on the host whether
  anyone polls or not. Nothing is left half-done by walking away.
* The start-cleanup above applies only to a window that is `ready` **and**
  carries the consumer's own holder — never to one that is already going
  away.

Since #1416 llama-server is a **router**: one process holds every preset and
the client picks with the `model` field of its `/v1` request, so a window no
longer swaps the server — it sets the environment and the set of presets a
client may ask for. Two additions, both additive on the contract:

* `thinking` is a third window name beside `foundry` and `coding`.
* A window refused because somebody else holds one now also says which **mode**
  stands and which presets it **allows**, so the caller can use the router
  instead of only learning that it cannot have the card. Every existing field
  is unchanged, and a caller that reads none of the new ones sees what it
  always saw.

Since #1435 there is **one** window, `erweitert`, and `foundry`/`thinking`/
`coding` are accepted as its older names. What separated them was only the set
of presets they allowed, and `erweitert` allows every preset the router knows —
so a caller that still asks for `foundry` gets the same window, is still
answered by the 12B (`alias`), still files under its own holder and still ends
the window the same way. `GET` reports the window under its name of today.

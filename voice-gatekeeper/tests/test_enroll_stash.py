"""Tests for the reverse enroll-stash (#376): the gatekeeper-side store and the
handler capture path.

The store mirrors uid_stash; the handler, when an enroll request is active and
speaker-ID is on, captures each onboarding turn's PCM as a sample and after N
enrols the averaged embedding in-process. Tests use a real sqlite db (the three
relevant tables replayed) and a stub extractor that returns a fixed 256-d vector.

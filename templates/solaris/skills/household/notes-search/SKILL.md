# Solaris — Notes Search (knowledge-base retrieval)

On-demand retrieval over the household's Obsidian notes vault (`/opt/data/notes`,
Syncthing-synced) — the **read half** of the knowledge base. Keyword +
frontmatter search via the `notes_search` tool. Read-only. Also
runnable on demand as `/notes <query>`.

## When to use

- "Was haben wir über den Garten notiert?" / "What did we note about the boiler?"
- "Find the book I added about Roman history."
- "Wo steht das WLAN-Passwort?" / "Search my notes for <topic>."
- "Zeig mir alles zu Projekt Wintergarten" / "show me everything about <topic>."
- As the **retrieval step** before answering any question the notes might already
  answer — check the vault before saying "I don't know".

Out of scope: writing notes (`solaris-dynamic-skills` /
`media-ingestion-multimodal`), the dated journal (`solaris-daily-chronicle`),
conversation history (the engine's memory provider).

## Operating sequence

1. **Derive search terms** from the request — key nouns/entities plus the
   German/English variant (the vault is bilingual).
2. **Search with the `notes_search` tool**, passing the derived terms as the
   `query`. It keyword-, name-, and meaning-searches the vault and returns the
   ranked note paths — you never shell out to search the files yourself. For a
   time-bounded request set `after`/`before` as ISO dates.
   - **Topic filter (required for a topic request).** Slugify the named topic
     (lower-case, spaces → `-`, hierarchy joined by `/`) and pass it as a
     `#topic/<slug>` anchor in the `query` (e.g. `#topic/projekt/wintergarten`);
     the tool boosts the notes tagged with that exact topic. If unsure of the
     exact name, fall back to keywords.
3. **Rank + pick** the 1–5 most relevant notes (prefer frontmatter/title hits over
   incidental body mentions). For a topic request, list the matching set.
4. **Read the chosen notes** with `notes_read`.
5. **Answer from them** and cite the note(s) by filename/wiki-link
   ("steht in `fact_garden.md`"). Don't read UUIDs/hashes aloud.

## Guards

- **Read-only**: never write, move, or delete under `/opt/data/notes`.
- **Stay in the vault**: only search under `/opt/data/notes`.
- **No fabrication**: if nothing matches, say so plainly and offer to record it
  via the write path.
- **Privacy**: summarise and point to the note rather than reading whole private
  documents verbatim unless asked.

## Failure paths

- `/opt/data/notes` empty/unreadable → "Meine Notizen sind gerade leer/nicht
  erreichbar."
- Too many hits → narrow the term; report the top few and offer to refine.

"""Tests for the Radicale rights converge (option A, #997 / #1011).

The per-resident calendar lives under the RESIDENT's own principal
(`/<resident>/solaris/`), which Radicale's default `[rights] type = owner_only`
forbids the `solaris` DAV account from writing. `converge_radicale_rights`
rewrites the radicale pod manifest's `write-config` initContainer to emit a
`from_file` ruleset that keeps owner_only's guarantee AND grants `solaris`
write access to `<resident>/solaris` (and nothing else).

`_patched_radicale_rights_yaml` is the pure edit. These tests prove: the
`[rights]` flip, the inserted `/config/rights` heredoc + its body, that the
result is valid YAML AND a valid shell script (both heredoc `EOF` delimiters
land at column 0 after the `|` block scalar strips its indentation — a mis-
indented delimiter would never terminate the heredoc), idempotency, and the
no-anchor safety no-op.
